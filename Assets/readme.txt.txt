This game is a 2.5d platform with an objective to reach the goal platform on the lower area of the stage in the given time frame (30s). It consist of three levels (scenes) each increasing in difficulty. Along the way there is spikes and meteors the player must avoid and account for as well. I hope the player feels excited and nervous during this game as they are force to beat it quickly yet must still be careful of obstacles. As well, I want them to feel accomplished as they complete increasing difficult levels.
